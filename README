A python client for the SQLShare REST API.

Documentation pasted here from:
http://escience.washington.edu/get-help-now/sqlshare-python-api

== Overview

1. Download the source and install the API

$ svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/sqlshare/pythonclient

2. Test the connection to the server using an example account by running the following from the source directory:

$ python test/testREST.py

3. Get your own API Key

4. Create $HOME/.sqlshare/config

[sqlshare]
host=rest.sqlshare.escience.washington.edu
user=your-sql-share-account-name
password=your-sql-share-account-key

5. Use the command line tools in tools/*, or write your own python programs using these tools as examples.

The remainder of this document provides some additional details.

== Source

The SQL Share Python API and clients are under src/python/sqlshare/ in the SVN repository and have following structure.

    src/python/sqlshare/
        sqlshare/ : the directory contains python module
        tools/
            multiupload.py : upload multiple CSV files
            permissions.py : manage ACL of SQL share datasets

== Setup
-- Install API

To use python API, you need to either install the module as site-packages or add the directory that contains python module to PYTHONPATHenvironment variable.

    To install as a site package, use python setup.py just like you install other 3rd party modules.
    Otherwise, add the path to src/python/sqlshare directory to PYTHONPATH environment variable.

-- Configure Access

    Create a SQL share account: Connect to SQL share web site and sign in using either UW Net ID or Google Account.
    Create an API key : To use python API, you need to obtain an API key to authenticate your python program. Get API Key.
    Create a configuration file

-- Configuration File

The python API reads login information from a configuration file.

    create $HOME/.sqlshare directory and place the configuration file config under it.
    You need your SQL share user name (user), API key (password) retrieved from SQL share web site.
    host is optional and only useful if you need to access features that are in development/testing.
    A sample content of config file is as follows.

[sqlshare]
host=rest.sqlshare.escience.washington.edu
user=your-sql-share-account-name
password=your-sql-share-account-key

== Append CSV files to an existing dataset

python append.py datasetName csvfile1 csvfile2 ... csvfileN

    datasetName is created if the dataset does not exist in SQL share.
    Each CSV file must have column header in the first line of the file.

== Upload CSV files

Uploading a CSV file is easy

python multiupload.py csvfile1 csvfile2 ... csvfileN

== Manage ACL

python permissions.py -t TABLENAME print
python permissions.py -t TABLENAME add user1 user2 ... userN
python permissions.py -t TABLENAME remove user1 user2 ... userN
